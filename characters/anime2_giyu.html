      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  Giyu Tomioka is a senior member of the Demon Slayer Corps
  and one of the most respected Hashira.
  He is known for his quiet demeanor, emotional restraint,
  and deep sense of responsibility.
  Beneath his calm exterior lies a man shaped by loss and guilt.
</p>
<p>
  Giyu survived a tragic past in which he lost close companions,
  including his fellow disciple Sabito.
  This experience left him questioning his own worth
  and carrying a persistent sense of self-blame.
  Rather than seeking recognition,
  Giyu chose solitude and discipline.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
  Giyu plays a pivotal role at the very beginning of the story
  by sparing Nezuko Kamado,
  an act that directly sets Tanjiro’s journey in motion.
  His decision demonstrates moral judgment beyond rigid rules.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout the narrative,
  Giyu acts as a silent guardian,
  intervening at critical moments
  while allowing others to grow through their own struggles.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
  Giyu’s actions challenge the inflexible traditions
  of the Demon Slayer Corps.
  His willingness to trust Tanjiro and Nezuko
  introduces doubt into long-held assumptions about demons.
</p>
<p>
  As the story progresses,
  Giyu’s emotional growth parallels the broader theme
  of overcoming guilt and self-isolation.
</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>
  Giyu is a master of Water Breathing,
  possessing exceptional precision and control.
  His techniques emphasize calm movement,
  efficient strikes, and defensive mastery.
</p>
<p>
  He developed the Eleventh Form of Water Breathing,
  Dead Calm,
  which allows him to neutralize enemy attacks
  with near-perfect stillness and focus.
