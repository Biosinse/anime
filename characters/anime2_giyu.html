      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Giyu is the stoic Water Hashira, a figure of quiet sorrow and unwavering duty. He carries the burden of many failed promises and conversations never had.
        His past is marked by loss and a rigid moral code he became a pillar of the Corps by refusing to allow tragedy to become meaninglessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        A master of Water Breathing, Giyu’s technique is like a river in both gentleness and sudden fury. He seldom smiles, and when he does, it carries the weight of surprising relief.
        He acts more as an anchor than a flare; other characters find in him a steady standard of competence.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Giyu’s main function is to test Tanjirō’s resolve early in the series and to introduce the audience to the Corps’ moral architecture.
        As Hashira, he is both mentor and judge: he offers aid but imposes the expectation of discipline.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Giyu’s interventions save and redirect pivotal arcs; his reputation forces enemies to respect or fear him, and his actions often drive formal recognition of apprentice slayers into the Corps’ inner circles.
