<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
Pieck Finger is a pragmatic, intelligent Warrior candidate who becomes the Cart Titan—an asset valued for endurance and utility. Her upbringing in Marleyan society as an Eldian soldier-to-be shapes her into an adaptable, observant operator rather than a charismatic ideologue. She develops a pragmatic code: survive, support the mission, and use whatever skill preserves the lives of comrades and advances practical objectives. Pieck combines a dry wit with a capacity for careful planning, making her an effective lieutenant on campaigns that demand logistical finesse rather than dramatic heroics.
</p>
<p>
She is less interested in rhetoric than in doing the daily work of war: carrying supplies, ferrying troops, and maintaining endurance in long operations. That utilitarian role shapes her personality—calm, perceptive, and quietly indispensable.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
Pieck acts as the silent professional whose talents keep campaigns operational. Her technical mastery of the Cart Titan role allows other Warriors to perform in concentrated bursts, while she handles the long grind. Narratively, Pieck’s presence reveals how war depends on often-invisible labor and how engineers and logisticians shape outcomes as much as frontline fighters.
</p>
<p>
Her quiet competence also offers a foil to more bombastic characters, showing that bravery and value takes many forms.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
Technically, Pieck’s Cart Titan enables strategic maneuvers—transporting heavy equipment, holding siege lines, and combining endurance with tactical timing. Her choices often permit others to reach decisive moments.
</p>
<p>
Symbolically, she demonstrates that survival in wartime depends on invisible, unglorified work and that the narrative’s success is as much about persistence as about heroics.
