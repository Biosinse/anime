<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
Floch starts as a nameless recruit whose grief and fury over comrades lost gradually coalesce into an extremist resolve. Initially without notable leadership traits, he is thrust into a chaotic war where he finds identity through a simple narrative: the enemy must be crushed. Floch’s conversion from follower to ideological leader is frighteningly plausible—loss breeds certainty, and certainty simplifies complexity into black-and-white answers. He learns to speak, organize, and command, discovering the intoxicating power of mobilizing others toward a singular, violent aim.
</p>
<p>
His psychology is carved by the needs of a society seeking scapegoats; he seizes the role with zeal. As his faction grows, Floch becomes more dogmatic, interpreting ambiguity as betrayal and dissent as treason. The war environment amplifies his extremist tendencies, and his rhetoric finds eager ears among people hungry for clarity and vengeance.
</p>
<p>
Floch’s journey is a cautionary tale about how righteous anger can be instrumentalized into political power.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
Floch proves that movements can be led by otherwise ordinary people who learn rhetorical skill and exploit fear. He transforms from a background figure into a prominent hardliner whose actions polarize the already fragmented human polity. His presence marks the rise of populist militarism within Paradis, influencing policy and pushing the nation toward aggressive solutions.
</p>
<p>
Narratively, he is a domestic antagonist—someone the protagonists must reckon with in their own ranks, not just on foreign battlefields.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
Floch’s organizational work creates factions that harden the society’s will to wage extreme warfare. He helps mobilize public support for radical policies, thereby escalating the plot’s stakes from military conflict to civil-mobilized campaign.
</p>
<p>
He also demonstrates how internal division can be as threatening as an external enemy, forcing protagonists to fight on multiple fronts: military, ethical, and political.
