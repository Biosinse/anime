      <h2>Long Character Biography</h2>
      <p>Itachi is a prodigious Uchiha who quickly rose to ANBU leadership. Faced with an impending Uchiha rebellion, he agreed to a catastrophic choice: eliminate his clan to prevent civil war and protect the village and his younger brother Sasuke. He framed himself as a villain to ensure Sasuke’s survival and growth. This sacrifice defined his life: exile, concealment, and joining Akatsuki to both monitor threats and bear the weight of his deception privately.</p>

      <p>Itachi’s inner life is complex: deep love for his brother, loyalty to the village, and the trauma of carrying collective guilt. He manipulates perception — presenting cruelty while safeguarding peace — making him one of the saga’s most difficult moral figures. His eventual revealed motives force Sasuke and others to reevaluate simplistic narratives about justice and heroism.</p>
