      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  Gabimaru, known as “the Hollow,” was once the most feared assassin of the Iwagakure ninja clan.
  Raised from childhood to kill without emotion, he was conditioned to believe that attachment,
  mercy, and hesitation were weaknesses. His life was defined entirely by violence,
  obedience, and survival.
</p>
<p>
  Despite his brutal upbringing, Gabimaru developed an inner conflict after marrying a woman
  who treated him with genuine kindness. For the first time, he experienced warmth and acceptance,
  emotions forbidden by his clan. This connection awakened his desire to live,
  contradicting the identity he had been forced to accept.
</p>
<p>
  Condemned to death for abandoning his clan, Gabimaru repeatedly survived execution attempts,
  earning his title as someone who could not be killed. Beneath this reputation,
  however, lies a man torn between wanting to die for his sins
  and wanting to live for the sake of love.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
  Gabimaru serves as the central figure through which Hell’s Paradise explores the meaning of life.
  Sent to the island of Shinsenkyo in search of the Elixir of Life,
  he represents a paradox: a man who claims he has no reason to live,
  yet refuses to die.
</p>
<p>
  His partnership with Sagiri forces him to confront moral questions he has long avoided.
  Through constant exposure to death, beauty, and monstrosity on the island,
  Gabimaru is pushed to reevaluate whether he is truly empty
  or simply afraid to accept his humanity.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
  Gabimaru’s internal struggle drives the philosophical core of the series.
  His resistance to death and refusal to surrender challenge both allies and enemies,
  influencing how other characters confront their own reasons for living.
</p>
<p>
  As the expedition descends deeper into chaos,
  Gabimaru becomes a symbol of defiance against a world
  that equates worth with purity or immortality.
  His journey exposes the cost of eternal life
  and questions whether survival alone has meaning.
</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>
  Gabimaru possesses exceptional physical strength, agility, and endurance,
  honed through years of assassination training.
  His body demonstrates extreme resistance to pain and fatal injury,
  allowing him to survive situations that would kill ordinary humans.
</p>
<p>
  He is highly skilled in ninjutsu, deception, and close-combat techniques,
  often using misdirection and environmental awareness to overwhelm opponents.
  As the story progresses, Gabimaru begins to awaken Tao,
  a life energy that enhances his abilities
  and reflects his internal struggle between life and death.
