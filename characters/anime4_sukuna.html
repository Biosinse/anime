      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Sukuna is the archetypal antagonist: ancient, charismatic in a terrifying way, and almost unimaginably cruel. In antiquity he was worshipped and feared in equal measure; his rage became legend and his body was fragmented into cursed objects to prevent his return. Despite his monstrous nature, Sukuna is not reducible to pure caricature the narrative gives him a personality that is regal, sardonic, and remorseless. His motives are self-determined: he seeks dominion and delight in the exercise of power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bound within Yuji’s body as a set of dispersed talismans, Sukuna’s presence on Earth is partial and intermittent. He is both a looming threat and a psychological test: he offers Yuji a vision of what power without compassion looks like, a seductive alternative to Yuji’s insistence on meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sukuna’s ancient mind sees modern sorcery as both amusing and beneath him; he is an antagonist who tests not only swords but moral resolve.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Sukuna’s role is catalytic: as the embodiment of unmitigated curse, he forces the sorcerers to confront the stakes of their power. He is a constant reminder that containment is merely temporary and that evil can be sophisticated as well as savage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sukuna’s interactions with Yuji create one of the series’ most compelling tensions: can a person who houses monstrosity still remain essentially human? The answer reverberates through the choices of other characters.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Sukuna advances plot by being an unpredictable variable: allies must mitigate his influence while enemies may try to manipulate the connection for their own ends. He also complicates the moral calculus by sometimes acting with unsettling logic, making the heroes’ choices harder and more morally ambiguous.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, Sukuna is both the story’s clearest danger and its most reflective antagonist the mirror in which the heroes’ values are tested.
