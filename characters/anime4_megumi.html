      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Megumi Fushiguro’s early life is gated by lineage and obligation. Born into the Zenin-related Fushiguro family, he carries the weight of expectations that he did not choose. His childhood was shaped by the absence of normal comforts and the pressure to conform to a sorcerer’s code: disciplined, solitary, and often unforgiving. He learned early to mask fear with a composed exterior and to measure his actions by outcomes for others rather than himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        While not naturally effusive, Megumi is morally rigorous in a way that reads like a quiet, internalized heroism. He is distrustful of spectacle and values the effectiveness of a measured plan. His technique, Ten Shadows, summons familiars that act as extensions of his will creatures that both reflect and reveal his complicated interior life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Megumi’s choices are often defined by sacrifice; he will willingly trade personal gain to preserve the possibility of a future for someone else. This proclivity aligns him with Yuji, who is similarly anchored in the belief that life deserves protection.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Megumi serves as the operational mind of youthful sorcerers: strategic, careful, and skeptical of grand gestures. He is a bridge between the moral clarity of Yuji and the tactical knowledge of the veterans. His prudence and stoicism make him a stabilizing partner on missions that demand reasoning under pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        His relationships (notably with Yuji and his mentor figures) are built around mutual respect and a recognition of different forms of courage. Megumi’s temperamental restraint often provides a counterbalance to impulsive choices, preventing catastrophes born of overreach.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Megumi’s summons and strategic acumen produce tangible advantages in battle. He shapes key confrontations by leveraging his familiars in ways that reveal enemies’ vulnerabilities. Thematically, his arc interrogates the costs of duty and the morality of inherited obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        His decisions particularly those involving collateral risk catalyze debates among the cast about sacrifice and the sanctity of the individual versus the collective good.
