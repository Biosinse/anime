      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Nurugai is an enigmatic figure whose knowledge of the island’s flora and fauna reveals him to be more than a simple criminal he has spent parts of his life in wild places and thus reads ecological signals other characters miss. His childhood likely involved living at the edge of society, learning the language of animals and plants in place of books and ceremonies. That awareness renders him unusually valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is often taciturn and suspicious, a man whose quiet competence belies an internal narrative built from necessity. On the island his survival skills enable the group to harvest resources and avoid natural hazards that would otherwise look fatal.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Nurugai functions as the group’s naturalist and survivalist. He decodes the island’s signals and teaches others to understand life there. His knowledge prevents wasteful mistakes and highlights the way local intelligence can trump brute force.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also represents a wisdom born of marginal living, showing that formal training is not the only source of valuable knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Nurugai’s guidance allows the party to exploit edible plants, avoid predators, and set ambushes. His minor but crucial interventions prevent ecological pitfalls that would otherwise decimate the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thematically his presence reminds the narrative that survival honors not only courage but humility and listening.
