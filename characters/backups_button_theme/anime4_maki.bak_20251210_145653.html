      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Maki Zenin was born into a powerful sorcerer family but was denied typical privileges due to an absence of strong cursed energy. Cast aside and scorned, she trained her body and skill to compensate for what nature did not grant. Her life became an act of defiance; she chose to carve value out of labor and discipline rather than lineage. This formative bitterness fuels her fierce independence and uncompromising standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maki’s weapons expertise and prosthetic apparatuses make her a fearsome combatant; she reconfigures inferiority into precision. Her emotional center is a complex mixture of rage, wounded pride, and a quiet loyalty to those who accept her on her terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Maki’s presence interrogates the aristocratic structures of sorcery she is proof that worth can be manufactured through will. She functions as a critique of inherited privilege and as a testament to human endurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In team dynamics, she often takes the role of tough-love disciplinarian, pushing others to the edge so they learn to survive.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Her combat prowess resolves several tactical impasses, and her background produces narrative arcs that force institutions to reckon with their biases. Maki’s victories are both practical and symbolic: they unsettle the assumptions that uphold the corrupted hierarchies of the sorcerer world.
      </p>
      <p>
        She also catalyzes conversations about merit, pain, and the costs of dignity.
