      <h2>Long Character Biography</h2>
      <p>Izuna fought alongside Madara during clan wars and helped refine early Sharingan use. A prodigious fighter and Madara’s brother, his death in battle leaves an enduring wound that feeds Madara’s distrust of the Senju and shapes the founding conflict that birthed Konoha. Izuna’s life is largely a historical touchstone — not a present-time actor — but his memory shapes later motivations and ideological turnings in the clan.</p>

      <p>Izuna’s legacy is thematic: a reminder that greatness often costs lives and that grief unprocessed can harden into revenge and ideology.</p>
