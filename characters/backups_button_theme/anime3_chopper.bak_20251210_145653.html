      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Chopper was a reindeer ostracized for strange features until he ate a Devil Fruit that blurred species boundaries. He learned medicine from a kindly doctor and chose to become a healer. His vulnerability is matched by a brave streak: he will rush into danger if it means saving a friend.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Chopper supplies the crew with medical care and empathy; his innocence is a moral compass that reveals the brutality of some antagonists.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond healing, Chopper’s transformations and knowledge of herbs are indispensable in weathering long voyages and strange afflictions.
