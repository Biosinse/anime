      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Tensen is a veteran of countless missions a man whose body is mapped by scars and whose decisions carry the gravity of experience. Once a soldier within the state apparatus, his career taught him the value of precision and the cost of error. Tensen’s life is an aggregation of choices he cannot undo; his mission on the island is both a professional trial and a personal reckoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an elder in the expedition, he often assumes the role of strategist, organizing small groups and anticipating the island’s lethal improvisations. He does not waste words; his presence is a steadying hand that keeps the younger and more impulsive members from making fatal mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beneath the outward stoicism, Tensen carries private grief that the island’s cryptic urgings sometimes stir. The mission for him is more than duty it is an attempt to reconcile failure with usefulness.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Tensen is the veteran leader archetype: experienced, disciplined, and emotionally reserved. He organizes, adjudicates disputes, and provides practical survival training to teammates unused to true wilderness. His presence counters the reckless impulses of criminals who believe violence is always the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also serves narratively to show the limits of institutional knowledge: what training can and cannot prepare one for when myth becomes physical.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        By coordinating expeditions and making hard calls, Tensen’s choices determine who moves forward and who falls behind. He often negotiates life-or-death decisions with clinical clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thematically, his arc interrogates whether institutional competence is sufficient for moral repair, or whether redemption requires more personal transformation than training can provide.
