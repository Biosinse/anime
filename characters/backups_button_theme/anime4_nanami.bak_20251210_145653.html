      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Kento Nanami’s life before re-entering jujutsu school reads like a cautionary tale: a talented sorcerer who left the field for a safe corporate existence. He is practical, sardonic, and infuriatingly principled. Nanami’s return to the field is driven not by glory but by the need to act on a sense of justice: the world, he believes, asks too little of those who can protect it. His demeanor masks a moral seriousness that frames much of the adult perspective in the series.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trained in efficient, clinical techniques, Nanami fights with the kind of bureaucratic precision that belies deep empathy. He is not showy but he is lethal and his work ethic models a different kind of heroism: quiet, deliberate, and consistent.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Nanami acts as a bridge between youthful enthusiasm and adult realism. His mentorship to younger sorcerers provides a template for how maturity and responsibility can balance recklessness without deadening it.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also embodies the theme that heroism is often a trade-off: he left safety for danger because remaining neutral felt like a moral failing.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Nanami’s interventions are surgical; he solves problems with targeted action rather than moral grandstanding. His presence deepens the stakes in fights where strategic thinking counts more than raw power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, Nanami’s choices reinforce the show’s insistence that ordinary decency is as rare and important as any arcane technique.
