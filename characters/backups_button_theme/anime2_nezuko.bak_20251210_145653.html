      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Nezuko's life begins in an ordinary warmth: a family, a small house, the rhythm of chores and meals.
        The massacre that ends this simplicity also breaks the rules of existence: she becomes a demon, yet not wholly erased.
        Nezuko’s condition is the story’s essential paradox she is demon by physiology but retains the ember of human feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the chaos of her transformation, Nezuko displays uncharacteristic self-restraint; she protects a human child and refrains from some basic demonic impulses.
        While she cannot speak at times, she communicates in small gestures: the tilt of her head, an effort at restraint, an occasional bloom of anger when those she cares for are threatened.
        Her arc is one of reclamation, an internal negotiation between the monstrous hunger that defines demons and the memory of a human life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time Nezuko develops abilities distinct from ordinary demons: a unique strength of body and an aura that resists permanent corruption.
        These changes are credited within the story to both bloodline and the intangible force of Tanjirō's compassion. Her presence softens the Corps’ assumptions about monsters.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Nezuko functions as the engine of Tanjirō’s moral decisions she is the reason he enters the Corps and the lodestar he returns to after every loss.
        Characters around her respond not only to a demon’s threat but to an uncanny humanness that complicates easy classification.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Nezuko enables the story’s ethical complexity: if a demon can be held between worlds, then the Corps’ mission is not only eradication but also discernment.
        Her survival expands options for characters and the audience alike; she is proof that compassion can be enacted even when logic screams otherwise.
