<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
Falco Grice is introduced as compassionate, earnest, and gentle—qualities that make him stand out in a militaristic youth culture. Raised among Marleyan expectations, he nonetheless displays early empathy toward those labeled enemies. His desire to protect others propels him toward the Warrior program, but his motivations are less ideological and more human: he seeks to keep loved ones safe. Falco’s kindness is a narrative counterweight to the harsher characters; he embodies the possibility of humane choices even when surrounded by conditioning that prizes aggression.
