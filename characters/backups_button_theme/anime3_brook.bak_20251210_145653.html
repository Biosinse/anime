      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Brook is a musician with a strange fate: he returned from death by a Devil Fruit and now travels as a living skeleton. His music carries longing and memory; he plays not just to entertain but to stitch together fragments of history and sorrow. Despite his macabre appearance, his personality is gentle and wise.

      <p>
        Brook lends the crew humor, culture, and a haunting knowledge of past losses; his songs open doors that swords cannot.

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        His music calms allies and unsettles enemies; and his mysterious past connects to lost narratives that shift the story’s historical stakes.
