      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Satoru Gojo emerges from the narrative as a nearly mythic figure: brilliant, irreverent, and terrifyingly powerful. Trained within a lineage of exceptional sorcerers, his raw talent is augmented by a decisive charisma and a refusal to accept the ossified traditions of the jujutsu hierarchy. Gojo’s youth was marked by a hunger for truth and a disdain for performative authority. He cultivates power as an instrument of change rather than prestige.
      </p>
      <p>
        His technique based on Limitless and the manipulation of space is conceptually elegant: he bends the geometry of conflict so that opponents face the impossible. The technique’s aesthetics match Gojo’s persona: cool, effortless, and singularly confident. Underneath the bravado is a deeply held conviction that the system must be reformed; he invests his power in protecting students and challenging corrupt structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his near-invincibility, Gojo’s character is not empty of tenderness; he cares for students and chooses to be a catalyst for change rather than an isolated god.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Gojo plays several roles at once: teacher, enforcer, and ideological beacon. As the most visibly powerful sorcerer, he acts as a shield for the younger characters, enabling them to grow under less immediate threat. His presence alters politics; his mere reputation changes how enemies plan and how factions align.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a psychological level, Gojo forces both allies and enemies to confront what power should be used for protection or domination. He is both a narrative solution and a provocation, because his power makes systemic reform possible but also paints a target on his back.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Practically, Gojo’s interventions are often the pivot points that allow the protagonists to survive existential threats. Thematically, his arc examines the perils of omnipotence: how a single actor with unchecked power can either be a benevolent reformer or a tragic isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        His choices when to exert influence and when to stand back create cascading consequences, affecting politics within the sorcerer world and reshaping enemy strategies.
