      <h2>Long Character Biography</h2>
      <p>Hidan hails from Yugakure (the Hidden Hot Water Village) and becomes a devout follower of Jashin, a violent cult promising immortality through ritual sacrifice. Fanaticism reshapes his life; he embraces suffering and worship through blood rites. Unlike many villains driven by power, money or ideology, Hidan’s motivation is religious zeal: sacrifice and slaughter are spiritual acts. After undergoing the Jashin ritual he becomes functionally immortal — standard mortal damage cannot kill him — and this change deepens his cruelty and sense of invulnerability.</p>

      <p>He pairs with Kakuzu in Akatsuki, their personalities clashing but complementing each other tactically. Hidan’s backstory shows the radicalising effects of ideological isolation and how a desire for transcendence can become violent. Over time Hidan’s actions leave a trail of trauma; his most notorious act — killing Asuma Sarutobi — triggers powerful emotional and plot consequences.</p>

      <p>Despite brutality, Hidan is not a one-dimensional force of chaos: his theology shapes his decisions and gives him a ritualistic logic. He believes deeply that he serves a divine law and that his killings are holy duty. That conviction gives Hidan a chilling calm in combat; death, for him, is pointless and to be mocked, leaving only the ritual as meaningful.</p>

      <p>Hidan’s arc ends with a tactical defeat rather than permanent death, reinforcing Naruto’s recurring idea: cleverness and teamwork can overcome brute fanaticism. Nevertheless, the horror of his actions and the grief they cause remain important to the series’ emotional beats.</p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>Hidan is an episodic but pivotal antagonist. His immortality introduces unusual tactical problems and forces protagonists to respond beyond simple strength. The emotional fallout of his actions (notably Asuma’s death) propels character development, especially for Shikamaru, who grows from apathetic strategist to decisive leader.</p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>Hidan’s greatest plot contribution is catalysing growth in other characters — his violence becomes the crucible for maturity, vengeance, and ultimately justice by intellect. His defeat is one of the series’ sharpest strategic victories: outsmarting an immortal foe.</p>
