      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Robin’s childhood was consumed by forbidden knowledge: the study of an erased history called the Void Century. Hunted and molded into secrecy, she abandoned trust until she met the Straw Hats. Her intelligence is matched by a cool resolve: she reads ruins and politics with the same steady hand.

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Robin provides historical context that shifts the stakes of the crew’s mission; her scholarship reveals why the world is structured as it is and why certain truths must be resurrected.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Her discoveries about the ancient past catalyze major arcs and put the crew on collision courses with the powerful elites who prefer forgetting.
