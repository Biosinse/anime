      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Toge Inumaki’s voice is his power; his speech is cursed in itself. He was trained to use selective words that translate into action, and as such he must limit his vocabulary to avoid harming the innocent. Toge’s childhood was disciplined by necessity: he practiced silence and symbolism so that his utterances would be precise and effective. This constraint formed an inward discipline and an outward mystery: his friends rely on his succinct commands and protect him in turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the constraints, Toge is gentle and protective; his nonverbal cues are as expressive as a long speech. The loneliness of being a walking weapon has taught him empathy and a weird, wry humor in moments of levity.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Toge is a tactical asset who intervenes in fights with single words that bend physics. Narratively, he is a moving metaphor for language as a tool that can both heal and harm. His friendships show how communities contain and transmit power without relinquishing humanity.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        His interventions often tip the balance in close battles; his unique curse speech allows for creative tactics that otherwise would be impossible. Toge also introduces themes about communication and responsibility what words cost and what silence buys.
