      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Muichirō’s manner is fog-bound: dreamy, distant, and startlingly precise when the moment demands it.
        He was a prodigious child who rose quickly through mastery yet struggled with emotional anchoring.
        The story frames him as someone who knows technique deeply but must be nudged back toward connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        His swordsmanship is like a mist: it obscures intention and then reveals devastating clarity. He fights with a kind of dreamy focus that confounds opponents.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Muichirō adds a contemplative axis to the cast: he shows how different temperaments can reach similar heights of skill.
        He forces other characters to rethink assumptions about strength and serenity.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        His interventions are often strategic and subtle, providing cover and sudden, decisive strikes in battles when brute force fails.
