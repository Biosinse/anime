      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Reiner is a tragic figure of divided loyalty. Raised and trained with a mission he scarcely chose, he grows into the role of warrior who believes he fights for his people but the methods and manipulations required to achieve that mission break his psyche. The tension between his camaraderie with the Survey Corps and the hidden identity he hides creates a pressure that transforms him into one of the story’s most complex antagonists.
      </p>
      <p>
        His mental collapse and subsequent attempts to reconcile identity, duty, and guilt form one of AOT’s central character studies: what happens when a person is asked to betray the friendships that humanize him in the name of a larger cause?
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Reiner’s role is to complicate the simple binaries of friend versus foe. He is both trusted comrade and covert antagonist; that duplicity forces the story to confront the painful consequences of espionage and indoctrination. He becomes a symbol of the costs of long-term deception on the individual who carries it.
      </p>
      <p>
        His narrative oscillations highlight the tragedy of being made monstrous by duty.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Reiner’s revelations are tectonic: they upend trust within the Survey Corps and force a restructuring of priorities. His internal conflict illuminates the human cost behind political conflict and demonstrates how ordinary bonds are weaponized by ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reiner’s arc is a persistent reminder that enemies are often formed by circumstance and that reconciliation requires more than battlefield victories.
