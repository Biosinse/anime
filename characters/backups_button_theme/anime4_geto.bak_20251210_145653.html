      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Suguru Geto’s backstory is woven with idealism turned dark. Once a promising sorcerer and a classmate of Gojo’s, he came to see the world’s suffering through a lens of purist judgment. What begins as righteous anger curdles into an ideology that valorizes purity and excludes those deemed weak. The story gives Geto a tragic symmetry: he was once a protector, someone who now seeks to protect a narrow vision of the world by purging it of what he calls impurities.
      </p>
      <p>
        His charisma and intelligence make him persuasive; he builds a following that shares his contempt for the status quo. This path turns him into a dangerous antagonist: not a mere monster but a political actor who represents a real alternative to the protagonists’ moral stance.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Geto acts as ideological counterpoint to Gojo and as a mirror to the costs of radicalization. Where Gojo believes in empowering others and protecting diversity, Geto believes in a purged order. This tension animates some of the series' central conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        His presence raises the stakes beyond physical battles he wages a culture war about the definition of value and the rights of humans versus nonhumans in a world of curses.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Geto catalyzes major arcs by organizing enemies and provoking crises that force the sorcerers to choose between pragmatism and principle. His methods make the world unsteady, forcing allies to reconcile personal bonds with institutional survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, Geto’s choices unpack the show’s major questions about the price of purity and the ethical costs of ideological certainty.
