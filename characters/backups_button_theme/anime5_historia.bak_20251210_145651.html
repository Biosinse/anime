      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Historia grows up as a forgotten child of a royal line, molded into anonymity by political families seeking safety in silence. Her journey from a self-effacing young woman into a queen who must represent and sometimes make impossible decisions is a study in identity reclaimed. The revelation of her true heritage forces her to confront what leadership demands: compassion, hardness, and the willingness to choose.
      </p>
      <p>
        She learns that being a symbol of hope requires performing rituals of governance that contain both benevolence and the necessity of difficult choices. Historia’s personal growth is about claiming agency when everyone assumes she should be passive.
