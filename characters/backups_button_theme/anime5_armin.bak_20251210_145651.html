      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Armin is introduced as physically weak and introspective, a boy whose power is not in swordsmanship but in imagination. He is a reader of maps and strategist of improbable plans. When others see obstacles, Armin sees possibilities; his intellectual curiosity grows into sharp tactical acumen. His friendship with Eren and Mikasa roots him in a social network that turns his ideas into action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Armin’s life is a model of courage that does not require physical force: he uses thought and empathy to craft plans that save lives. As the narrative progresses and truths become darker, Armin’s role expands from planner to moral interpreter someone who must weigh the ethics of choices that affect masses.
      </p>
      <p>
        His character is a pivot point for the theme that intellect can be as potent and dangerous as any physical weapon when wielded without compassion.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Armin is the strategic conscience of the trio: his ideas convert chaos into leverage. He proposes plans that expose truths or circumvent stronger foes. As the war widens, Armin becomes the voice asking whether ends justify means and whether the liberation of one people requires the annihilation of another.
      </p>
      <p>
        His growth into leadership positions forces him to make the very compromises he once mapped only on paper.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Armin’s strategies frequently create the openings that save comrades and shift the course of campaigns. He also embodies the narrative’s central dilemma: knowledge is dangerous; the more one sees, the harder the moral demands become.
      </p>
      <p>
        His decisions echo through the plot as the series asks whether a thinker can retain humanity when the world demands ruthless action.
