<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
Connie begins as a light-hearted, energetic cadet from a rural village who brings comic relief and strong instincts to the squad. Raised in the pastoral outskirts, his background makes him practical and tactile; he values family, food, and the small comforts of home. The reveal that his village has been turned into mindless Titans is a shattering moment that forces him into grief that is both personal and communal. This tragedy deepens his resolve—Connie grows from an impulsive youth into a soldier who understands the stakes and who learns to shoulder sorrow.
