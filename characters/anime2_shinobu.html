    <main class="section">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  Shinobu Kocho is a prominent member of the Demon Slayer Corps
  and one of its Hashira.
  She is known for her gentle smile, calm voice,
  and composed demeanor, which often mask her true emotional depth.
  Beneath her serene appearance lies a woman shaped by tragedy,
  loss, and an unyielding desire for justice.
</p>
<p>
  Shinobu grew up alongside her older sister, Kanae Kocho,
  who served as the Flower Hashira.
  Kanae’s belief in coexistence between humans and demons
  deeply influenced Shinobu’s worldview.
  However, when Kanae was killed by a powerful demon,
  Shinobu’s optimism was shattered,
  leaving behind grief and suppressed rage.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than allowing hatred to consume her,
  Shinobu chose a controlled path.
  She continued to smile, honoring her sister’s ideals,
  while internally carrying the weight of loss and anger.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
  Shinobu plays a dual role as both a frontline warrior
  and the chief medical expert of the Demon Slayer Corps.
  She oversees the Butterfly Estate,
  where injured demon slayers are treated and rehabilitated.
  Her presence ensures the survival and recovery of countless fighters.
</p>
<p>
  In battle, Shinobu represents an alternative approach to demon slaying.
  Rather than brute force,
  she relies on precision, intelligence, and calculated strikes,
  redefining what it means to be strong within the Corps.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
  Shinobu’s research into demon physiology
  significantly advances the Corps’ understanding of their enemies.
  Her development of poison-based techniques
  compensates for her physical limitations
  and creates new strategies for defeating demons.
</p>
<p>
  Her long-term planning and willingness to sacrifice herself
  play a critical role in weakening powerful adversaries,
  proving that preparation and intellect
  can be just as decisive as raw strength.
</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>
  Shinobu practices Insect Breathing,
  a style derived from Flower Breathing.
  This technique emphasizes speed, agility,
  and pinpoint accuracy over physical power.
</p>
<p>
  Unable to decapitate demons due to her lighter build,
  Shinobu wields a uniquely modified sword
  designed to inject lethal doses of wisteria poison.
  Each thrust targets vital points,
  allowing her to neutralize demons efficiently.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to combat,
  Shinobu possesses extensive medical knowledge.
  Her expertise in poisons, antidotes, and anatomy
  makes her indispensable both on and off the battlefield.
