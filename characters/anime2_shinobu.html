      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Shinobu exudes a deceptively gentle manner; she smiles in ways that promise something softer than the reality of her craft.
        She specializes in poison-based techniques, turning her background as an apothecary’s daughter into a lethal art.
        Yet beneath the soft voice is a core of iron and a claustrophobic grief that shaped her outlook on demons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her life was shaped by personal loss a memory that lingers in her polite words and sudden bursts of ferocity.
        She channels cruelty into creativity: her blades are hollow, containing toxins that incapacitate demons rather than attempting the traditional decapitation.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Shinobu is a foil to Tanjirō’s overt compassion: where he tries to reach a demon’s humanity, she treats the tincture of hate as a chemical problem to be solved.
        Her presence broadens the ethical frame of the Corps, asking when mercy is possible and when only containment works.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Shinobu’s techniques offer alternative approaches in battles where conventional answers fail; her knowledge of toxins provides strategic advantages and uncovering vital lore about demon physiology.
