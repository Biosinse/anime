      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  Muichiro Tokito is a prodigy within the Demon Slayer Corps
  and the youngest individual to ever attain the rank of Hashira.
  From an early age, he demonstrated extraordinary talent,
  mastering swordsmanship and breathing techniques at a pace
  unmatched by most experienced demon slayers.
</p>
<p>
  Muichiro’s childhood was marked by tragedy.
  After losing his family to demons,
  he became emotionally detached and forgetful,
  distancing himself from painful memories.
  This emotional numbness shaped his quiet,
  absent-minded personality in his early appearances.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
  Muichiro serves as a representation of lost innocence
  within the Demon Slayer narrative.
  His detached demeanor contrasts sharply
  with the intensity of the battles he faces,
  highlighting the cost of war on young warriors.
</p>
<p>
  As the story progresses,
  Muichiro gradually reconnects with his emotions
  and sense of identity,
  allowing him to fight not just with skill,
  but with purpose.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
  Muichiro’s personal growth mirrors the broader theme
  of reclaiming one’s humanity after trauma.
  His regained memories strengthen his resolve
  and deepen his commitment to protecting others.
</p>
<p>
  His presence in major battles
  demonstrates that age does not define strength,
  and that clarity of purpose can transform raw talent
  into true heroism.
</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>
  Muichiro is the Mist Hashira,
  specializing in Mist Breathing,
  a style characterized by disorienting movements
  and unpredictable attack patterns.
</p>
<p>
  His exceptional speed and precision
  allow him to confuse opponents
  and strike with deadly accuracy.
  Combined with his natural talent,
  Muichiro’s abilities place him among
  the most formidable Hashira.
