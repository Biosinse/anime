      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Chōbei is one of the expedition’s rougher edges a criminal whose past deeds are plain and whose survival instincts are sharp. He represents the class of people sent on the mission who have nothing to lose and often little to hope for. His life has been a series of compromises, and the island offers him both a chance for pardon and the proof that once shaped by cruelty, a person may find some parts of themselves difficult to reclaim.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the island, Chōbei’s bluntness can be both a source of tension and a crude kind of truth. He sometimes provides practical brutality that the group needs but also forces ethical reckonings about what methods the party will accept to survive.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Chōbei acts as a foil to more noble characters: where they seek redemption, he often shows how easy it is to choose convenience and cruelty. His presence prevents the story from becoming sentimental; he reminds the audience that some people adapt to violence rather than reforming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, under pressure, even Chōbei reveals moments of surprising loyalty that complicate the easy expectation that violent pasts inevitably predict future depravity.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        His actions precipitate skirmishes and sometimes force the group into defensive strategies. He also catalyzes moral crises that demand decisive leadership and personal sacrifice from other characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thematically, Chōbei embodies the difficulty of institutional mercy: can someone trained by cruelty unlearn it, and should the state gamble freedom on that possibility?
