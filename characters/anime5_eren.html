      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Eren grows up in the sheltered routine of life inside Wall Maria’s shadow, a restless boy with a hunger for freedom that feels like a physical ache. He is shaped by stories of the outside and the mythic urge to see the sea. That urge becomes agony when titans breach the wall and destroy the familiar Eren loses his mother, his boyhood ends in a day of smoke and screams, and the drive to destroy every titan is carved into him like a commandment.
      </p>
      <p>
        His training as a soldier is brutal and pragmatic, shaping raw anger into focused capability. Eren’s youth is a cauldron of anguish, fury, and an idealistic conviction that killing titans will restore meaning. But as the story grows, his identity becomes more complicated: he inherits Titan powers that shift the scale of his agency. Those powers change how he sees the world and how the world sees him from a symbol of hope to a possible instrument of devastation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biography of Eren is defined by escalation: his personal grief radiates into geopolitical consequence. He moves from a boy seeking revenge to a figure grappling with radical choices about who deserves survival and how far one may go under the banner of liberation.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Eren is both protagonist and plot engine. His Titan abilities create the central conflicts and the exponential stakes that force other characters into impossible decisions. As secrets emerge about the origin of titans, the truth of the outside world, and the history hidden by the walls Eren’s moral path diverges from the simpler vows of his youth. He embodies the story’s most uncomfortable question: can justice, once pursued with absolute conviction, become indistinguishable from atrocity?
      </p>
      <p>
        His relationships with Mikasa and Armin anchor his humanity even as his actions become more radical. At times he is a savior; at other times he is a catalyst for mass destruction. The narrative uses Eren to show how trauma can calcify into ideological ferocity.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Eren’s transformations literally into Titan and metaphorically into a revolutionary force shift the entire arc: missions change in scale, politics rearrange, and the fate of nations hangs on decisions he makes. He forces allies to examine the moral costs of their alliances and opponents to confront the consequences of historical injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, his arc asks whether the road to freedom can be built without becoming another form of domination. Eren’s choices push the plot into its most fraught territory, where redemption and condemnation become disturbingly entwined.
