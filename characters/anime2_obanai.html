      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Obanai is a strict, disciplined presence: sharp-jawed, lit by an austere moral compass and a lifetime of self-discipline.
        He was shaped by hardship and a rigid belief in order, which he enforces even among allies.
        His life’s detail includes a sense of duty to correct injustice through uncompromising means.
      </p>
      <p>
        He fights with unique serpent-like swordwork, a style both beautiful and unsettling. He trusts few but cares deeply for those he does.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Obanai is often the stern voice of disciplined action, challenging any tendency toward sentimentality or sloppy strategy.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        His rigor stabilizes operations during chaotic encounters and provides tactical solutions the Corps might otherwise miss.
        Obanai’s presence forces protagonists to refine their methods and sometimes to confront their own compromises.
