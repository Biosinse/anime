      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  Sagiri is a skilled executioner from the Yamada Asaemon clan,
  a family entrusted by the shogunate to carry out executions with precision and honor.
  From a young age, she was trained to view death not as cruelty,
  but as a duty carried out with discipline and respect.
  This upbringing shaped her into a calm, composed individual
  who suppresses emotion in favor of control.
</p>
<p>
  As a woman in a traditionally male role,
  Sagiri faced constant doubt and scrutiny.
  Rather than resisting openly,
  she internalized these judgments,
  questioning her own worth and strength.
  Her hesitation in executing prisoners
  reflects not weakness,
  but a deep awareness of the value of life.
</p>
<p>
  Sagiri’s inner conflict stems from the contradiction between her role as an executioner
  and her personal belief that life should not be taken lightly.
  This struggle defines her identity throughout the story.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
  Sagiri serves as both guardian and moral anchor during the expedition to Shinsenkyo.
  Assigned to oversee Gabimaru,
  she initially views him as a criminal deserving of death.
  However, as she witnesses his refusal to surrender to death,
  her rigid beliefs begin to unravel.
</p>
<p>
  Through her interactions with Gabimaru and others,
  Sagiri becomes a lens through which the series examines justice,
  authority, and personal conscience.
  She gradually shifts from blind obedience
  to independent moral judgment.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
  Sagiri’s presence introduces the theme of restraint versus control.
  Her hesitation to kill contrasts sharply
  with the island’s obsession with immortality.
  This contrast highlights the difference between respecting life
  and attempting to dominate it.
</p>
<p>
  As the journey progresses,
  Sagiri’s growth influences the decisions of those around her.
  She becomes a stabilizing force,
  preventing brutality from consuming the expedition entirely.
</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>
  Sagiri is a highly trained swordswoman,
  specializing in precise, controlled strikes rather than overwhelming force.
  Her execution style emphasizes accuracy, posture, and timing,
  reflecting her disciplined mindset.
</p>
<p>
  She also begins to awaken Tao,
  the life energy that governs balance on Shinsenkyo.
  Unlike others who use Tao aggressively,
  Sagiri’s Tao manifests through restraint and clarity,
  reinforcing her role as one who protects life
  even while standing at the edge of death.
