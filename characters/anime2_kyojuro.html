      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Kyojuro is the Flame Hashira, bright as his style of combat and embodied by an almost religious joy in living.
        Raised with a sense of duty and a fierce commitment to protect, his presence in the Corps feels like sunlight in a dark hall.
        His optimism is neither naive nor performative; it is a deliberate stance against despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rengoku’s background includes hard training and family stories about honor and resilience. He treats each mission as an act of guardianship.
        His techniques are explosive, disciplined, and crafted to devastate while preserving his center of calm.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Kyojuro serves as a standard-bearer for what the Hashira might be at their best: courageous, selfless, and inspiring.
        His interventions coax hidden strengths from younger slayers, especially during the story’s most desperate arcs.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Rengoku’s role often centers on sacrificial leadership; he takes stands that change the morale of entire battalions and forces the protagonists to raise their game.
