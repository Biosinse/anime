    <header><h1>Nezuko Kamado</h1></header>

    <main class="section">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  Nezuko Kamado was born into a warm, close-knit family living a modest life in the mountains.
  As one of the eldest siblings, she was gentle, caring, and naturally protective of those around her.
  Her early life was defined by responsibility and kindness, traits that would later become central
  to her identity even after her transformation.
</p>
<p>
  Her life changed abruptly when her family was slaughtered by demons while Tanjiro was away.
  Nezuko survived the attack but was turned into a demon herself.
  Unlike others who lost their humanity completely, she retained emotional awareness
  and an instinctive bond with her brother.
  This internal resistance marked her as an anomaly within the demon world.
</p>
<p>
  Despite the overwhelming hunger that accompanies demonhood,
  Nezuko demonstrated extraordinary mental strength by refusing to consume human flesh.
  Her restraint was not imposed by fear or control, but by memory, love, and instinct,
  allowing her to preserve a sense of self even while transformed.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
  Nezuko serves as living proof that demons are not irredeemable.
  Her existence challenges the Demon Slayer Corps’ rigid beliefs
  and forces its members to confront uncomfortable truths about their enemy.
  She becomes both a source of hope and a catalyst for change.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout the story, Nezuko repeatedly protects Tanjiro and others,
  often placing herself in danger without hesitation.
  Though unable to speak normally, her actions consistently communicate empathy,
  courage, and loyalty.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
  Nezuko’s presence fundamentally alters the direction of the narrative.
  Her resistance to sunlight later becomes a pivotal development,
  shifting the balance of power between demons and humans.
</p>
<p>
  More than a fighter, Nezuko represents the emotional foundation of the series.
  Her survival gives meaning to Tanjiro’s journey
  and reinforces the central theme that compassion can endure even in monstrous forms.
</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>
  As a demon, Nezuko possesses enhanced physical strength, rapid regeneration,
  and the ability to alter her body size to increase power or conserve energy.
</p>
<p>
  Her Blood Demon Art, Exploding Blood, allows her to ignite her own blood into flames
  that harm demons without affecting humans.
  These flames can weaken demonic techniques and provide crucial support in battle.
</p>
<p>
  Nezuko also develops an unprecedented resistance to sunlight,
  a trait unheard of among demons,
  making her existence uniquely significant within the Demon Slayer world.
