      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Kanji is a minor but pivotal member of the party: a tactical fighter whose skills carry a pragmatic streak. He grew up in a context where life demanded a certain efficiency of action; his training and temperament fit the mission’s moment-by-moment cruelty. Kanji’s personal history is unornamented, a background that makes him a clear-eyed instrument of group survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        He tends to blend into the party’s muscle not commanding scenes but shaping them through decisive interventions at crucial moments. Kanji’s story is a reminder that agency is often distributed across many small contributions rather than single heroic performances.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Kanji functions as the practical fighter: he takes assignments that require straightforward courage and steady blades. His presence stabilizes teams that might otherwise fall victim to indecision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Narratively, he keeps scenes grounded with a soldier’s perspective and resists romanticizing the dangers they face.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Kanji’s decisive strikes and battlefield competence create tactical wins that enable more complex strategies to unfold. His small victories often cascade into larger successes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thematically, he symbolizes the quiet, distributed labor of survival the idea that many hands turning can change fate’s machinery.
