    <header><h1>Mikasa Ackerman</h1></header>

    <main class="section">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Mikasa’s early childhood is marked by loss and rescue: her family was slaughtered when she was very young, and Eren then a friend saved her life. That moment of rescue binds her to him in ways that are deep and enduring. Raised afterward within Eren’s household, Mikasa assumes the role of protector, her instincts honed into vigilant skill. Her Ackerman bloodline grants her uncanny combat reflexes; she becomes a supremely capable soldier, whose calm in battle hides an inner landscape of fierce loyalty and private sorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mikasa trains relentlessly, not for glory but as an expression of duty toward those she loves. Her life is organized around a single, overriding dedication: keep Eren safe. That devotion complicates when Eren’s arc grows morally ambiguous; she must reconcile love with the demands of justice and the conflicting loyalties that define the narrative’s moral pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her identity is a study in devotion: capable, restrained, and haunted by the knowledge that her strength makes her a weapon she sometimes wishes not to be.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Mikasa is the stoic heart of the central trio Eren’s protector and Armin’s pillar. She acts as the stabilizing force when chaos threatens to disintegrate the group’s cohesion. Her presence offers an intimate contrast to the grand political arcs: when leaders debate mass strategy, Mikasa’s decisions are intimate and immediate who to save, when to step in, and when to hold back.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moral complexity of her role deepens as Eren’s choices become darker; she must decide where love ends and duty begins, and whether she can oppose the man who once saved her life.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Mikasa’s combat prowess often changes the outcome of battles and protects pivotal characters; narratively, her loyalty provides emotional stakes. In arcs where merciless choices are demanded, she embodies the personal cost of grand strategy the way that decisions made on maps ripple into private grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her struggle to reconcile devotion with moral clarity enriches the story’s interrogation of allegiance and agency.
