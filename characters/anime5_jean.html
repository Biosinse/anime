      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Jean starts out as pragmatic, self-interested, and skeptical a soldier who wants survival and a predictable life. Over time, the crucible of war changes him; he learns leadership, responsibility, and a willingness to sacrifice. Jean’s transformation from a man who chooses the easiest path to one who accepts the weight of command is slow but convincing, reflecting the narrative’s insistence on the human capacity to grow amid crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        His personal development is not a clean arc: he makes mistakes, doubts, and then chooses again. That repetition makes him feel authentic and useful as a touchstone for ordinary soldiers whose heroism is measured in steadiness rather than spectacle.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Jean acts as a pragmatic voice on the battleground and a steady leader as the story’s political demands grow. He is the embodiment of ordinary courage not flashy but effective, and morally engaged in the consequences of strategic choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also provides contrast to more reckless heroes, showing that leadership can come from tempered choices rather than raw fury.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Jean’s decisions shape squad-level outcomes and his growing leadership influences troop morale and tactical cohesion. He symbolizes how the average person can become the backbone of survival strategies, and his choices often provide the human scale to larger political decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many arcs, he is the steady hand that keeps desperate plans from becoming chaotic tragedies.
