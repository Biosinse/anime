        <h2>Long Character Biography</h2>
        <p>Katsuyu is a colossal slug from the Shikkotsu Forest, allied with the medical ninja tradition centered on Tsunade's lineage. As a summon, Katsuyu functions less as a battlefield boar and more as a living system: she can split into swarms, travel long distances, and deliver chakra-based healing and communication across the battlefield. Over time, Katsuyu is called upon to protect injured shinobi, relay messages in crisis, and form a distributed healing network that can render battlefield triage feasible at scales otherwise impossible.</p>

        <p>Katsuyu's temperament is calm, maternal, and almost algorithmic: she performs tasks without drama, yet her presence is emotionally resonant because she literally carries life between combatants. Her bond with Tsunade connects to the clan of medical-nin: it is both spiritual and pragmatic, a partnership that embodies the ethic of care. As Sakura learns and grows under that tradition, Katsuyu becomes an extension of her will and a literal means of enacting the medical shinobi's commitment to preservation.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
        <p>Katsuyu's primary role is medical and logistical: she heals, transports, and coordinates care across battlefields. This makes her indispensable in large-scale wars where quick triage and patient movement are the difference between survival and death for many. She is also a communication relay-able to ferry chakra-based messages over distances and maintain a constant contact network among medical units.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
        <p>Katsuyu's interventions save numerous lives in crucial arcs: she stabilizes wounded leaders, performs distributed healing during the Fourth Great Ninja War, and helps keep command nodes functional by ensuring wounded strategists can continue to participate. Without Katsuyu and the medical corps, the toll of war would be dramatically higher.</p>

        <p>Symbolically, Katsuyu reinforces the theme that preservation, care, and stubborn refusal to surrender to casualty are forms of heroism. Her presence nudges the narrative away from martyrdom toward sustained rebuilding and the protection of human life.</p>
