      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Nami’s childhood combined an uncommon intelligence with a history of heartbreak. As a child she learned to read storms and charts the way others read faces. Her earliest life was marked by exploitation coerced mapmaking under the control of cruel overlords which seeded her two central aims: to draw a map of the world and to buy back her freedom.
        Her talent for navigation is matched by a pragmatic streak; she calculates risk the way others breathe. Nami’s warm smile hides a stubborn ledger of debts she intends to repay with interest.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Nami transforms journeys into possible strategies: she reads currents, deciphers islands, and keeps the crew from becoming lost in more ways than one. Her maps are both literal charts and moral compasses: she measures human terrain as much as sea lanes.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Her navigation often unearths secrets (hidden islands, currents of fate) that unlock plotlines; her knowledge can avert disaster and expose the lies of island rulers. She is the pragmatic axis that makes grand dreams achievable.
