    <main class="section">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  Tanjiro Kamado grew up in a humble mountain village, living a peaceful life with his family.
  As the eldest son, he carried the responsibility of supporting his siblings and helping his mother,
  developing a strong sense of duty and compassion from an early age.
  His gentle nature and emotional awareness made him deeply connected to those around him.
</p>
<p>
  His life changed forever when his family was brutally slaughtered by demons while he was away.
  Returning home to devastation, Tanjiro discovered that his sister Nezuko was the sole survivor,
  though she had been transformed into a demon.
  Rather than giving in to despair or hatred, Tanjiro chose to protect her
  and search for a way to restore her humanity.
</p>
<p>
  This tragedy became the foundation of Tanjiro’s resolve.
  Instead of being consumed by vengeance, he committed himself to preventing others
  from suffering the same loss, shaping the compassionate warrior he would become.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
  Tanjiro serves as the moral center of the Demon Slayer narrative.
  As a member of the Demon Slayer Corps, he confronts terrifying enemies
  while maintaining empathy for their suffering.
  His ability to acknowledge the humanity within demons sets him apart
  from many other demon slayers.
</p>
<p>
  Through his actions, Tanjiro influences allies and adversaries alike,
  encouraging understanding rather than blind hatred.
  His journey challenges the belief that strength must come at the cost of kindness.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
  Tanjiro’s determination to cure Nezuko drives the main storyline forward.
  His unique perspective gradually reshapes how the Demon Slayer Corps views demons,
  especially those who retain traces of their humanity.
</p>
<p>
  His growth as a swordsman and leader allows him to stand against increasingly powerful threats,
  playing a crucial role in major battles that alter the balance between demons and humans.
</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>
  Tanjiro practices Water Breathing, a combat style that emphasizes fluid movement,
  adaptability, and endurance.
  Through disciplined training, he learns to synchronize his breathing
  with precise sword techniques, increasing his combat effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
  He later awakens the Hinokami Kagura, a traditional dance passed down through his family.
  This technique grants him access to Sun Breathing,
  dramatically enhancing his strength, speed, and stamina in battle.
</p>
<p>
  Tanjiro also possesses an exceptionally sharp sense of smell,
  allowing him to detect emotions, intentions, and weak points,
  giving him a strategic advantage against powerful opponents.
