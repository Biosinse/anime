      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Shion is a background figure whose life is shaped by constraint and service a person accustomed to following orders, to moving quietly, and to maintaining the small rituals that keep a group functioning. Often underestimated, Shion’s skills are practical and unglamorous: tending equipment, mending wounds, and carrying messages between fractured parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the island’s chaos, Shion’s value becomes clear: they are someone who preserves continuity. Where larger personalities clash, Shion smooths edges and ensures the tiny practicalities of survival are not ignored. Their small, consistent labor becomes a moral argument for how ordinary life can persist amid monstrous conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Shion functions as the group’s logistical heart: unspectacular but essential. Their presence prevents minor crises from becoming catastrophes, and they supply the narrative with a domestic perspective on a story often dominated by spectacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also act as a witness, quietly recording the moral omissions and small acts of courage that larger arcs might overlook.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Shion’s practical interventions—repairing a broken tool, setting a simple trap, or carrying a crucial message—produce micro-turning points that save lives or enable tactical success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thematically, Shion reminds the story that survival is made of small, unflashy acts and that heroism often involves maintenance rather than headline deeds.
      </p>
