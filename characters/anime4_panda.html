      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Panda is an animated being created under the guidance of Principal Masamichi Yaga, but his nature is complex: he is constructed from multiple cores, which grant him different forms and temperaments. His origin makes him a unique artifact that challenges definitions of personhood. Raised among humans and taught to value companionship, Panda’s personality blends curiosity and blunt honesty.
      </p>
      <p>
        His different cores can take different shapes in combat, producing variable strengths and tactical flexibility. This literal multiplicity symbolizes the show’s broader interest in what constitutes identity.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
      <p>
        Panda functions as both comic relief and surprising depth; he is physically formidable but emotionally accessible. He bridges the world of strange sorcery objects and human relationships.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Panda’s transformations solve puzzles and fight problems that require adaptability. He also underscores the show’s ethical questions about creation, autonomy, and the responsibilities of creators to their creatures.
