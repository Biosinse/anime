      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Hange is the scientist-soldier whose curiosity about Titans is both a saving grace and a dangerous obsession. She approaches the monstrous not only with weapons but with hypotheses, experiments, and the stubborn belief that understanding a thing is the first step toward subduing it. Her intellectual fervor drives breakthrough discoveries while also exposing her and her team to risks other commanders might avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a leader, Hange fuses knowledge and compassion she sees Titans as mysteries that must be studied and humans as lives that must be protected. That dual focus makes her indispensable in campaigns where both tactical and scientific solutions are needed.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Hange is the engine of discovery: she unearths the biological and mechanical truths that unlock narrative turns. Her labs become scenes of revelation where the monstrous is reframed as explainable, and thus potentially controllable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her enthusiasm is contagious and sometimes unnerving; she pushes the Survey Corps to test hypotheses that repurpose battlefield logic into research.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Hange’s research produces strategies and technologies that change how humanity fights and understands Titans. She provides the intellectual scaffolding for missions that depend on specialized knowledge rather than brute force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her moral orientation ensures that science in the story is not purely instrumental; it is also humanistic, asking why discoveries should be used and to what ends.
