        <h2>Long Character Biography</h2>
        <p>Raashi, the jinchuuriki of Son Goku (the Four-Tails), is known for his rugged experience and powerful fire-and-lava-themed techniques. From a frontier village not as prominent as Konoha or Kumo, Raashi earned renown through durability, ferocity and the capacity to use the Four-Tails' chakra to create overwhelming area-of-effect attacks. His life as a jinchuuriki combined soldiering with the burden of being a living weapon-he trained, fought and guarded his people while managing the dangerous chemistry between host and beast.</p>

        <p>Raashi's personality is often described as battle-hardened and pragmatic: he values protection of people over abstract ideology and is willing to use overwhelming force when required. Like many jinchuuriki, Raashi's story is a mix of honor and tragedy; he resists capture but ultimately becomes the target of Akatsuki's quest for beasts. The arc of his life, capture, and later fate adds to the tragic pattern of jinchuuriki exploited as objects in a larger war economy.</p>

        <p>Raashi's presence reminds readers that jinchuuriki exist across diverse cultures and that their experiences vary depending on village policy and support structures. He personally contributes to the narrative's breadth by representing the Four-Tails' distinct temperament and the different martial applications of tailed-beast power in combat.</p>

        <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
        <p>Raashi serves as an exemplar of a regional jinchuuriki who is nonetheless consequential in the broader conflict. His battles are spectacular and brutal; his capture or defeat motivates local and allied responses and underscores Akatsuki's ruthlessness in pursuing tailed beasts.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
        <p>Raashi's capture advances the Akatsuki's resource-gathering arc-his defeat signals to other villages that the organization is both capable and merciless. This contributes to mounting tensions among villages and to the urgency of protecting remaining jinchuuriki.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, Raashi's fighting style adds variety to the tailed-beast battles and informs Naruto and others about the tactical possibilities and dangers of different beast-host combinations.</p>
