      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Zoro began as a village boy who trained with a singular hunger: to be the world’s greatest swordsman. His discipline was forged in loneliness and competition. He learned to endure pain as a companion rather than an enemy and that endurance translated into an almost monklike dedication to craft.
        A promise to a childhood friend became his north star: he vowed to never return until the title of the best swordsman was his. When he met Luffy, he saw a captain worth following not because of prize but because of conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zoro uses an unconventional three-sword style, a technique that reflects his stubborn, idiosyncratic approach to power: when others rely on technique refinement, Zoro often relies on sheer will shaped by skill. His compass is honor and his metric of success is the ability to protect the people he cares about.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Zoro is the crew’s bulwark: in fights where plans collapse he stands resolute. His presence allows Luffy to be reckless because Zoro tends to the consequences. He is also the moral tone that balances Luffy’s childishness a quiet reminder that promises must be kept.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Zoro’s duels often clear paths for the Straw Hats to progress; his personal quest intersects with political arcs, where his victories help topple tyrants or test the limits of corruption. In many arcs, Zoro’s strength is the decisive factor allowing the crew to survive.
