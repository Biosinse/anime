      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Zenitsu is at first glance comic relief: trembling, dramatic, and convinced of his own uselessness.
        Yet beneath the comic veneer lies a boy raised with sharp instincts and a profound, if buried, courage.
        He survived a difficult upbringing that taught him to fear, and he learned to mask fear with showmanship and sarcasm.
      </p>
      <p>
        When truly awake and his true self appears most often when unconscious Zenitsu operates with a rare clarity of movement.
        He becomes a fierce fighter, employing Thunder Breathing forms with the speed that belies his usual panic.
        His character arc is about learning to accept worth without constant validation and to let loyalty outweigh self-doubt.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Zenitsu balances the team: his fear makes Tanjirō’s bravery more luminous, and his hidden prowess saves lives at surprising times.
        He exemplifies a theme in the show: heroic action can arise from flawed, frightened people.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Zenitsu’s moments of action are often decisive; they provide key victories during missions while also causing other characters to reassess the nature of courage.
        His growth from cowardice to consistent ally deepens the group dynamics and provides emotional beats between larger conflicts.
