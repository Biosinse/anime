    <main class="section">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  Zenitsu Agatsuma was an ordinary boy who grew up lacking confidence and self-belief.
  Frequently burdened by fear and anxiety, he struggled to find purpose or direction in life.
  His circumstances worsened when he was deceived into joining dangerous situations
  due to his trusting nature and desperation to avoid loneliness.
</p>
<p>
  His path changed when he was taken in by a former Thunder Breathing swordsman
  who trained him in the ways of the Demon Slayer Corps.
  Despite constant self-doubt and fear, Zenitsu endured harsh training,
  driven more by survival instinct than confidence.
</p>
<p>
  Though outwardly cowardly, Zenitsu’s persistence reveals an inner strength
  that emerges during moments of extreme danger.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
  Zenitsu provides emotional contrast within the Demon Slayer narrative.
  His fear-driven reactions highlight the terrifying reality of facing demons,
  making the dangers feel more grounded and human.
</p>
<p>
  Despite his cowardice, Zenitsu repeatedly rises to the occasion,
  proving that bravery does not mean the absence of fear,
  but the ability to act despite it.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
  Zenitsu’s development demonstrates that even deeply insecure individuals
  can grow into capable warriors.
  His moments of unconscious combat reveal his true potential
  and foreshadow his gradual emotional growth.
</p>
<p>
  Through teamwork and shared battles,
  Zenitsu strengthens the bonds within his group,
  reinforcing the importance of trust and cooperation.
</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>
  Zenitsu is a practitioner of Thunder Breathing,
  though he has mastered only the First Form.
  Despite this limitation, his execution of the technique
  is exceptionally fast and precise.
</p>
<p>
  When unconscious or under extreme stress,
  Zenitsu enters a heightened combat state,
  allowing him to fight with calm focus and deadly efficiency.
  His speed during these moments rivals even elite demon slayers.
</p>
<p>
  Zenitsu also possesses highly acute hearing,
  enabling him to detect faint sounds and movements,
  giving him an advantage in tracking enemies and sensing danger.
