      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Levi’s upbringing in the lawless underground forged him into a consummate survivor: clean, precise, and emotionally guarded. He climbs from the city’s filth to a position of unparalleled combat dominance. Ackerman blood grants him reflexes beyond normal limits; his training and temperament make him an efficient and feared soldier. Levi's personal history is a ledger of loss, hard choices, and a cultivated indifference that hides a deep loyalty to comrades.
      </p>
      <p>
        His life is devoted to duty; he is reluctant to indulge sentiment. He carries scars from battles and from losses that mark him as a leader who knows the true cost of command.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Levi is the tactical and moral backbone of the Survey Corps a commander who acts when others hesitate and who bears the heavy responsibility of frontline decisions. He enforces discipline and models the cost of survival. His presence reassures allies and terrifies enemies; as a narrative device, he demonstrates what mastery looks like when tempered by grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Levi also provides a moral counterpoint: he refuses romanticism about war and insists on pragmatic measures that prioritize the living.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        His combat feats change the course of crucial fights; his leadership stabilizes desperate scenarios and his choices often determine the survival of key characters. Levi’s personal sacrifices function as emotional high points that remind the audience of the human toll of strategic victories.
      </p>
      <p>
        His stoicism under pressure lends the story realism: real people pay for victories with raw grief, and Levi carries that grief onward.
