      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Raised in the wild and wearing a boar’s head as a talisman, Inosuke survived by clawing forward with a feral bluntness.
        He learned to fight before he learned to speak politely; his early lessons were measured in survival rather than etiquette.
        This upbringing shaped him into a fighter who trusts instinct above all else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inosuke’s journey is one of socialization: learning that a team’s coordinated tactics are not a constraint but a force multiplier.
        He adapts his feral talent into a disciplined skillset, discovering forms of breathing and footwork that channel his raw power.
      </p>

      <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
      <p>
        Inosuke provides kinetic energy and a challenge to group cohesion: he provokes fights, he breaks tension, and he catalyzes character growth through rivalry and respect.
      </p>

      <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
      <p>
        As missions demand physical improvisation, Inosuke’s wild thinking finds solutions others would not try.
        His presence ensures that brute force, when refined, becomes a strategic asset rather than an accident of violence.
