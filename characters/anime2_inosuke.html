    <main class="section">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  Inosuke Hashibira grew up isolated from human society,
  having been raised in the mountains under harsh and dangerous conditions.
  Separated from his mother at a very young age,
  he survived by relying on instinct, strength, and adaptability.
  This upbringing shaped his aggressive personality and animal-like behavior.
</p>
<p>
  With no formal education or social guidance,
  Inosuke developed a survival-based mindset,
  measuring worth through strength and combat ability.
  His lack of exposure to human interaction
  caused him to struggle with communication and emotional expression.
</p>

<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>
  Inosuke represents raw instinct and physical dominance within the Demon Slayer group.
  His unpredictable behavior contrasts sharply with Tanjiro’s compassion
  and Zenitsu’s fearfulness, creating balance within the team.
</p>
<p>
  Despite his rough demeanor,
  Inosuke gradually learns the value of teamwork and trust,
  forming meaningful bonds through shared battles.
</p>

<h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
<p>
  Inosuke’s unconventional fighting style introduces unpredictability
  into combat situations, often catching enemies off guard.
  His presence forces allies and enemies alike
  to adapt to constantly changing circumstances.
</p>
<p>
  Over time, Inosuke’s emotional growth becomes evident
  as he begins to acknowledge fear, loss, and companionship,
  adding depth to his character beyond physical strength.
</p>

<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
<p>
  Inosuke uses Beast Breathing,
  a unique combat style he developed himself.
  This technique emphasizes feral movement,
  erratic attacks, and heightened sensory awareness.
</p>
<p>
  His flexibility and abnormal bodily control
  allow him to dislocate joints and evade fatal attacks,
  making him extremely difficult to defeat.
</p>
<p>
  Inosuke also possesses an enhanced sense of touch,
  enabling him to detect opponents through vibrations in the environment,
  even when visibility is limited.
