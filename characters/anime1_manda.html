      <h1>Manda - The Snake King</h1>
      <p class="muted">Manda is Orochimaru's massive and temperamental summon: a force of speed, constriction and deadly venom, whose cooperation is always transactional and dangerous.</p>

        <h2>Long Character Biography</h2>
        <p>Manda is the greatest of the serpent summons-ancient, enormous, and cunning. Unlike many summons that form mutual contracts with humans, Manda is fiercely independent: he follows those who can dominate or pay him best, and his loyalty is conditioned on strength and respect. Over the series he appears primarily alongside Orochimaru and other snake-affiliated figures, embodying the snake clan's philosophy of control, cunning, and predatory opportunism.</p>

        <p>Manda is not simply brute force; he is calculated and dangerous, able to unmake formations and crush fortified positions with speed and constriction. His temperament reflects the moral ambiguity of his typical allies-willing to serve, but only under terms he deems acceptable. His interactions with human summoners are often transactional, featuring threats, threats repaid, and the occasional begrudging respect when strengths align.</p>

        <h2>Role in the Anime</h2>
        <p>Manda functions as a swift heavy unit-fast for his size, lethal in constriction, and able to deliver venomous attacks that can neutralize powerful foes. He is used as a strike asset, capable of bypassing fortifications and wrecking command centers. Manda's presence also signals danger: a summon of his caliber rarely appears without major consequences for those who face him.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Contribution to Plot</h2>
        <p>Manda's interventions accelerate battles and demonstrate the cost of alliances with snake-summon power. He raises the stakes of Orochimaru's schemes by providing an almost unstoppable physical threat and helps make Orochimaru's faction a credible endgame contender in multiple arcs. If he fights, protagonists must adapt tactics rapidly, often calling on other great summons or combined strategies to counter him.</p>

        <p>His presence contributes to narrative tension and underlines the summoning contract's moral economy: power that is not reciprocally bonded tends to bring volatility and danger.</p>
